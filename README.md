# FAIR Data Evaluation of Austria's Open Data Strategy

This project evaluates the adherence to FAIR Data principles in Austria's Open Data Strategy. The FAIR Data principles aim to enhance data value by making it Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Our research focuses on assessing the FAIRness of data available on the Austrian open data portal, data.gv.at, and analyzing the results to provide insights and recommendations.

## Project Overview

### Background
Introduced in 2016, the FAIR Data principles have become a cornerstone in improving data management and sharing practices. These principles are essential for increasing transparency, accountability, and efficiency in various sectors including research, healthcare, and urban planning.

### Research Question
How FAIR is the Open Data Strategy of Austria?

**Sub-questions:**
1. Which Austrian provinces adhere the most to the FAIR data principles?
2. Which categories adhere the most to the FAIR data principles?
3. Which FAIR data principles are most frequently violated?

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from the Austrian open data portal, data.gv.at.
2. **FAIRness Evaluation**: Perform a FAIRness evaluation using existing tools and potentially extend these with additional metrics.
3. **Analysis**: Analyze the evaluation results to derive statistics and visualizations.
4. **Conclusions**: Interpret the findings to answer the research questions and provide recommendations.

## Project Workflow
- **Initial Phase**: Project idea development, initial evaluation, and project proposal creation.
- **Data Collection**: Gather relevant datasets from data.gv.at.
- **FAIRness Evaluation**: Use tools like integrity-tester and FAIR-checker to evaluate the datasets.
- **Analysis**: Analyze and visualize the results to identify trends and insights.
- **Final Phase**: Prepare a comprehensive final presentation and video summarizing the findings.

## Tools and Resources
- **Integrity-tester**: A tool to check dataset integrity and adherence to FAIR principles.
- **FAIR-checker**: A tool to evaluate the FAIRness of data based on specific metrics.
- **Repositories**: Zenodo, OneData, and other repositories for data storage and sharing.
